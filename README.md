# Application Overview

#### Summary:  
This document contains information on the C3PO application.  3CPO is a generic project management and
communication application that supports multiple users via remote login to a central server.  The application handles 
both project requirements and reported bugs, provides scheduling assitance for the latter into sprints, and allows 
users to communicate in real time using a chat feature.  

#### Contents:
This document is divided into two major sections; User Guide and Development Guide.  The User Guide contains user 
information and instructions that orient a new user to the system capabilities and use.  The Development Guide
contains information for system deveopers who want to understand and modify the internals of the application.  

## User Guide

### User Accounts

Before a user can access the various 3CPO features s/he must log in.  Log in provides two important functions; a) it 
authenticates the user (ensures that they are allowd to access the system), and b) it informs the system of the user
identity.  This user identity is used to note 'who did what' in the history log, who is talking via chat, etc.
